 Designed an analog temperature classification system using LM35 without a microcontroller.
◦ Implemented band-based LED indicators: Red (Hot > 30°C), Green (Normal 20–30°C), Blue (Cold < 20°C).
◦ A compact comparator-based circuit for real-time feedback that demonstrates key analog interfacing and temperature sensing concepts.
